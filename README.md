## Terminal environment

### Pre-requisites

### GIT

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

[documentation](https://git-scm.com)

**macOS**

```bash
brew install git
```

**linux**

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

#### Homebrew (if you are using macOS)

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.

[documentation](https://brew.sh)

**macOS**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### ZSH

Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

[documentation](https://www.zsh.org)

**macOS**

```bash
brew install zsh
```

**linux**
```bash
apt install zsh
```

change shell, only for the current user, after this you HAVE to relogin to work

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

#### STOW


GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place. For example, /usr/local/bin could contain symlinks to files within /usr/local/stow/emacs/bin, /usr/local/stow/perl/bin etc., and likewise recursively for any other subdirectories such as .../share, .../man, and so on.


[documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)


**linux**


```bash
sudo apt install stow

```

**macOS**

```bash
brew install stow
```

#### Fuzzy Finder (FZF)

It's an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want.

[documentation](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

**macOS**

```bash
brew install fzf
```

**linux**

_debian install by default version 0.38_

```bash
sudo apt install fzf
```
